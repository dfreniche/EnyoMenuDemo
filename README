# Enyo Menu Demo

__This example uses Enyo v1.0, which is now obsolete. You should be usong Enyo 2__

## Enyo Repo on Github

[https://github.com/enyojs]()

## What is this

Just a simple example of a fixed menu in the left and several views changing in the right, including views with SlidingPanels

Took me a couple of days to figure this out, so I thought it would be helpful for other people trying to learn Enyo

You can use this project as a template for your new Enyo App. It starts with five options and five views. Easy to expand!

If you use it, drop me a line (http://blog.freniche.com/contactar/). Virtual hugs are always appreciated!

## How to use it

To use this code you __need__ to download the [Enyo 1.0 code](https://github.com/enyojs/enyo-1.0)

Uncompress it in the parent directory of this example, you need this structure:

    Enyo example
    |
    |- enyo-1.0-master
    |- EnyoMenuDemo
    
That's all, open index.html and you're good to go!
