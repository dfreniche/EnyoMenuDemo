-----------

Just a simple example of a fixed menu in the left and several views changing in the right, including views with SlidingPanels

Took me a couple of days to figure this out, so I thought it would be helpful for other people trying to learn Enyo

You can use this project as a template for your new Enyo App. It starts with five options and five views. Easy to expand!

If you use it, drop me a line. Virtual hugs are always appreciated!
